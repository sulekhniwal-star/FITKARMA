about('what happened in 1951');
about('what was the situation in nineteen fifty');
// Between 1938 and 1951, there was a notable transition in the Indian nutrition
// scenario. Among tropical regions, India contributed substantially in the field
// of nutrition (Nicholls, 1945). The incidence of pellagra was noticed and the
// role of niacin in its cure was successfully demonstrated in India (Raman, 1940;
// Aykroyd & Swaminathan, 1940). The agricultural practices in India also underwent
// modifications with concomitant increase in the crop yields. However, the basic
// diet of individuals remained inadequate, devoid of animal fats and proteins,
// due to poor economic conditions (Day, 1944). The translation of nutrition research
// into sustained public health was hindered by obstacles of weak economy, ignorance
// and poverty (Aykroyd, 1941). Other deficiency diseases such as maternal anaemia,
// infant beriberi and osteomalacia continued to be rampant. Sustained nutritional
// issues prompted the revision of Indian FCT resulting in the publication of fourth
// edition of the Health Bulletin No. 23 by Aykroyd, Patwardhan, and Ranganathan (1951).
