# ✅ FitKarma — Project TODO
> **Beginner-friendly task checklist** · Work through phases in order · Each task is self-contained
> 
> **Legend:** 🟢 Easy · 🟡 Medium · 🔴 Hard · 🔒 Security-critical · ⚡ Do this first in the phase

---

## 📋 How to Use This File

- Work **top to bottom** — later phases depend on earlier ones.
- Mark tasks done with `[x]` in your editor.
- Each phase can be a separate **Git branch** (e.g. `feat/phase-1-setup`).
- Don't skip the 🔒 tasks — they protect user data.
- Stuck? The section number links back to the developer docs.

---

## Phase 0 — Developer Environment Setup

- [ ] 🟡 Create Storage buckets: `avatars` and `posts_media`
- [ ] 🔴 Deploy Appwrite Function: **FCM Push Notifications** (copy from Section 17.5)
- [ ] 🔴 Deploy Appwrite Function: **Razorpay Webhook** (copy from Section 17.6)

---

## Phase 19 — Monetization (Razorpay)

- [ ] 🔴 Implement Razorpay webhook in Appwrite Function — verify HMAC signature before updating `subscriptions` collection
- [ ] 🟡 Implement free-tier data archival — show data for 7 days, archive older records, restore on upgrade
- [ ] 🟢 À la carte workout pack purchases (one-time payment)

---

## Phase 20 — Localisation (8 Indian Languages)
- [ ] 🟡 Configure `flutter_localizations` in `pubspec.yaml` and `app.dart`
- [ ] 🟡 Create `.arb` files: `app_en.arb`, `app_hi.arb`, `app_ta.arb`, `app_te.arb`, `app_kn.arb`, `app_mr.arb`, `app_bn.arb`, `app_gu.arb`
- [ ] 🟡 Add all string keys to `app_en.arb` first
- [ ] 🟡 Translate all strings — use a professional translator or community contributors (not just Google Translate)
- [ ] 🟢 Verify Devanagari rendering on Android (Hindi, Marathi) and Gujarati/Bengali scripts

---

## Phase 21 — Accessibility
- [ ] 🟡 Add `Semantics` widgets to all interactive elements — screen reader support
- [ ] 🟢 Test with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS)
- [ ] 🟢 Ensure all text scales correctly when the system font size is increased to 200%
- [ ] 🟢 Build high-contrast mode — add a toggle in Settings

---

## Phase 22 — Testing
> *Write tests alongside the feature, not after the whole app is done.*

### Unit Tests (target ≥ 60% coverage for `/data/` and `/domain/`)
- [ ] 🟡 TDEE / BMR formula — all goal types and activity factors
- [ ] 🟡 Blood pressure `classify()` — all AHA threshold boundaries
- [ ] 🟡 Glucose `classifyFasting()` and `classifyPostMeal2h()`
- [ ] 🟡 Dosha quiz scoring algorithm
- [ ] 🔴 AES-256 round-trip — encrypt then decrypt all sensitive models (period, journal, BP, glucose, appointments)
- [ ] 🟡 Karma XP accumulation with streak multipliers
- [ ] 🟡 Fasting stage machine — in-progress, completed, broken states
- [ ] 🟡 Recipe calorie auto-calculation from ingredient list
- [ ] 🟡 Sync conflict resolution for all data types from the conflict matrix
- [ ] 🟢 Referral code uniqueness (collision probability test)

### Widget Tests
- [ ] 🟡 `ActivityRingsWidget` — various progress levels (0%, 50%, 100%, overflow)
- [ ] 🟡 `BPTrendChart` — correct colour banding for all AHA classifications
- [ ] 🟡 `FastingProgressRing` — correct phase labels and countdown
- [ ] 🟡 `GlucoseHistoryChart` — target bands per reading type
- [ ] 🟡 `DoshaDonutChart` — segment proportions for all dosha combinations
- [ ] 🟢 `ShimmerLoader` and `ErrorWidget` — render in all async states
- [ ] 🟢 `MoodEmojiSelector` — tap selection and slider interactions

### Integration Tests
- [ ] 🔴 Full food log flow — search → select → confirm → verify Hive write → verify sync queue entry
- [ ] 🔴 Offline → online sync — log items offline, restore connectivity, verify Appwrite document created
- [ ] 🔴 Auth flow — register → onboarding → dashboard loads from Hive
- [ ] 🔴 Period encryption — log entry → read back → verify decryption → verify raw Hive bytes are not plaintext
- [ ] 🔴 BP log flow — log → AES encryption → correct AHA classification displayed
- [ ] 🔴 Fasting flow — start → advance time → eat → verify completion and XP awarded
- [ ] 🟡 Recipe builder — add ingredients → calculate → save → log → verify calorie total
- [ ] 🟡 Meal planner → food log — plan a meal → log it → verify `log_method: planner`
- [ ] 🟡 Referral flow — generate code → sign up with code → verify XP awarded to both parties

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] 🟡 Dashboard cold start < 2s on a 3 GB RAM device
- [ ] 🟡 Hive food search < 200ms against a 10,000-item database
- [ ] 🟡 Sync queue flush — 20 records < 5s on a 3G connection
- [ ] 🟡 PDF report generation < 3s for a 30-day report
- [ ] 🟢 BP/Glucose chart render < 300ms with 90 data points
- [ ] 🟢 Memory leak check — food log screen after 50 entries

---

## Phase 23 — CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] ⚡🟡 Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — copy the GitHub Actions workflow from Section 24
- [ ] 🟡 Add `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`, `APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID` as GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] 🟡 Add `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, Fitbit/Garmin client IDs as GitHub secrets
- [ ] 🔴 Add `.env.prod` to GitHub secrets (never commit the file itself)
- [ ] 🟡 Configure Codecov to track test coverage
- [ ] 🟡 Deploy Appwrite Functions via CLI — copy the `appwrite deploy` commands from Section 24
- [ ] 🟢 Set up the daily backup cron (Appwrite DB export → Backblaze B2)

---

## Phase 24 — Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] 🔒🔴 Final security audit — check every Appwrite collection has correct `Role.user(uid)` permissions
- [ ] 🔒🔴 Verify no secrets are hardcoded in Flutter source (`grep -r "client_secret"`)
- [ ] 🔒🟡 Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore` — run `git log --all -- .env` to confirm it was never committed
- [ ] 🔴 Verify sensitive data in Hive is actually encrypted — read raw bytes and confirm they are not plaintext
- [ ] 🔴 Test payment flow end-to-end in Razorpay **test mode** before enabling live keys
- [ ] 🟡 Verify installed app size < 50 MB — run `flutter build appbundle --release` and check output
- [ ] 🟡 Cold start benchmark < 2s on a real mid-range device (not a simulator)
- [ ] 🟡 Test offline mode thoroughly — enable airplane mode and use every core feature
- [ ] 🟡 Test on a real 2G/3G connection with Low Data Mode enabled
- [ ] 🟢 Verify all 8 language `.arb` files are complete — no missing keys
- [ ] 🟢 Test with TalkBack / VoiceOver — all interactive elements reachable
- [ ] 🟢 Submit to Google Play (internal track first) and Apple App Store (TestFlight first)
- [ ] 🟢 Set up Sentry DSN and verify crash reports are coming through from the production build
